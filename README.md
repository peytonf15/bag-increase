# eac-work
Work for UH campus safety - as a project that my boss has allowed me to work on.

Ultimately, students will be able to submit a complaint about their door or whatever else that is not working from this front end. 
I plan on building the middle and back-end out with Node.js(Express framework) and MongoDB. 

This is public to introduce my peers to Bootstrap 4's "floating labels" example and it can be implemented into any form. 

The front end url is: https://peytonf15.github.io/eac-work/
