This is copied over from my eac-work during my stay in college. The goal of this is to have a simple way to keep track of my paychecks over time. Perhaps yours too once I add multiple users. 

This is public to introduce my peers to Bootstrap 4's "floating labels" example and it can be implemented into any form.
